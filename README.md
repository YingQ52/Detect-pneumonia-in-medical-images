# Detect-pneumonia-in-medical-images

This work is collaborated with Zhengdi Shen.

-	Built a U-net-like stacking deep learning model to classify pneumonia regions from Chest X-ray images 
-	Developed 3 U-net architectures to combine coordinates and YOLO and RetineNet, and ChexNet outputs
-	Compared U-net stacking model with YOLOv3, Retinanet on 5000 X-ray images, and U-net model showed highest AU- ROC and average accuracy on detecting pneumonia
